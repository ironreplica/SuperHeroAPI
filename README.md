This API demonstrates how to build a basic API using the .NET framework and implementing CRUD operations. Key featues include
- CRUD operations
- Microsoft SQL Server Integration
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Tools
- Entity Framework

This project taught me a lot about how to create API's in .NET.
